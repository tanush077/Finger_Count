# CountFingers-OpenCV
This project utilizes advanced image processing techniques to detect hands, segment fingers, and perform real-time finger counting.

## Features

- **Hand Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV's methods to isolate and identify the hand within the frame.
- **Finger Segmentation:** Employs image processing techniques for finger extraction.
- **Finger Counting Algorithm:** Analyzes extracted fingers to count their number.
- **Real-time Processing:** Provides live finger counting capabilities.
